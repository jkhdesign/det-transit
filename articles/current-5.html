<p>Both the QLine and People Mover are infamous among Detroit residents for their lack of practicality. Although it could be marginally helpful for those visiting the city, for Detroiters who live within the city, taking the bus is quicker and cheaper (though notably less pleasant). The QLine, since launch, has faced a surge of issues such as frequent delays, inconsistent stops, low ridership, mechanical failures, accidents, and a ballooning budget: it is recovering less than 10% of its expenses from fares.</p>

<p>One of the largest issues with the M-1 streetcar system is its integration with regular automobile traffic, which forces its movement to rely on other drivers instead of designating a lane to just the QLine. Because of this, the streetcars were involved in 46 accidents between 2017 and 2018. Additionally, streetcar operators—when interviewed—mentioned that they’re often overworked and exhausted and that they’re denied lunch breaks.</p>
