        <h1 class="title">A Cycle of Poverty</h1>
        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p><strong>Lower Wage Jobs</strong></p>
<p>As of 2011, over 10,000 DHPH residents working for lower-wage jobs commuted to cities and townships that have opted out of SMART. &nbsp;Nearly 40% of these workers earned less than $1,250 per month, or under $15,000 in annual wages – meaning that their wages are close to, or potentially under, the federal poverty rate of roughly $11,000.</p>

<p><strong>High Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Detroit’s insurance rates are some of the highest in the country: an average annual premium is $5,414 while the national average is just below $1,500. Further, high premiums comprise an average of 18% of Detroiters’ income. For perspective, anything over 2% is considered unaffordable by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Federal Insurance Officers. This is largely because auto insurance companies use drivers’ credit scores in calculating rates. Drivers with poor credit scores pay more than twice for their insurance than someone with an excellent score. This is a big problem for Detroit residents, who collectively have some of the lowest credit scores in the country. An estimated 60 percent of Detroiters drive without insurance. That’s compared to 13 percent nationally, and about a third of Motor City residents don’t even own a car.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Other reasons why car-ownership in Detroit is so unattainable can be attributed to Michigan’s no-fault insurance, with unlimited Personal Injury Protection. Because of this, insurance providers are required to cover unlimited medical damages in accidents and there are no medical fee schedules that outline how much hospitals can charge. This results in a huge influx of lawsuits in Michigan, with high medical bills: some MRI centers charge as much as $5,300 for an MRI that would cost less than $1,000 at other locations. Because insurers need capital to cover these expenses, it drives up the price of insurance for everyone.</p>
